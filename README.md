# Advent of Code 2024
These are my answers to [advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

**SPOILER WARNING:** If you're trying to solve the puzzles yourself, I strongly advice against looking at the files in this repository. You have been warned.

I am using PHP this year to solve the puzzles. I will try to avoid using third party packages as far as is possible, but depending on what happens I might have to install some dependencies in the future.

I am using PHP 8.4 for the puzzles.

To run a specific puzzle all you need to do is run:
```bash
php DAY/index.php
```
(replace DAY with the corresponding day, for example: `php 1/index.php` will run the puzzle for December 1st)
